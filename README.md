# Program Title (edit this)

Program Description
The game's goal is to reach the top finish line while avoiding contact with the falling lava and the blocks. Before the actual game, a home screen appears. To pass the home screen and move directly into the game, the player must press the letter “r”. In addition, there are the basic up, down, left and right keys to be used in the game. When the player collides with falling lava or buildings, they are respawned in their original starting position. If the player touches the blocks, they automatically restart from the starting position again.
